Mount Solren — The Ember Peaks
Mount Solren is an active volcanic mountain range in the eastern region of Elarion. Rivers of lava flow through its canyons and the air shimmers with heat. Fire-resistant enemies like Magma Golems and Ember Sprites are common here. Kira Ashveil trained here as a young mage. The mountain's peak contains the Solren Vault, a dungeon filled with ancient fire-magic artefacts.

Frostpeak Pass — The Frozen Corridor
Frostpeak Pass is a treacherous mountain crossing in the far north, permanently blanketed in snow and ice. Blizzards can reduce visibility to near zero. The area is home to Ice Wraiths and Frost Giants. Dax Frostholm grew up in a village at the base of the pass. Players who brave the crossing can reach the hidden city of Coldharrow, which contains rare crafting materials.

Eldengrove — The Ancient Forest
Eldengrove is a vast, ancient forest in the western part of Elarion. Its trees are hundreds of metres tall and block out most sunlight, making the forest floor dark and atmospheric. The forest is home to woodland creatures, treants, and the occasional corrupted dryad. Mira Thornweave was raised in a ranger outpost deep within Eldengrove. The forest contains hidden paths that can only be found by tracking animal trails.

The Shattered Wastes — The Ruined Heartland
The Shattered Wastes is the former capital of the old Elarion empire, destroyed in the catastrophic war that gave the game its subtitle. The landscape is fractured and unstable, with chunks of earth floating in the air above chasms. Undead enemies and rogue constructs wander the ruins. This is the endgame region and is significantly more difficult than the other three areas. The final boss of the game, the Lich-King Malachar, resides in a fortress at the centre of the Wastes.
