Knight
The Knight's real name is Edric of the Stonemarsh, though he has never voluntarily told anyone in the arena. He grew up as the youngest of four children on a grain farm in a low-lying region called the Stonemarsh, where the soil is dark and the winters are long. He taught himself to fight at fourteen using a sharpened fence post after a wolf pack began taking the family's livestock. His older siblings moved to cities. Edric stayed and ran the farm until a recruiter for the arena passed through during a harvest festival and watched him break up a tavern fight without spilling his drink. He entered the arena the following spring with borrowed armour and has never once described it as a career. He keeps a small pouch of Stonemarsh soil tied to the inside of his belt, which he touches with his left hand before every match. Nobody has ever seen him do this. He is considered the backbone of many decks due to his balanced health and damage output, his reliability under pressure, and his complete absence of ego about it. He has a longstanding rivalry with the Prince, who considers him an embarrassment to the concept of a warrior. Edric finds the Prince deeply tiresome and has never once acknowledged the rivalry, which makes it worse.

Giant
Nobody has ever learned the Giant's name. He was present at the arena before most of the current record-keepers arrived, and the earliest logs simply refer to him as "the large one" and later "the Giant," which stuck. He does not seem bothered by this. He responds to it the same way he responds to most things — with patience and a mild, unhurried attention that arena staff describe as disarming given his size. Those who have fought alongside him consistently report that he hums while marching toward towers: a low, slow, tuneless sound that nobody has ever identified as a real melody. Morwenna, the Witch, believes he is making it up as he goes. The Giant has a deep fondness for wildflowers and is frequently observed crouching to examine them between matches, which takes considerable effort given the mechanics of his knees. He has been seen carefully relocating small flowers that were growing in arena floor cracks rather than letting them be trampled. He harbours a slow, deep grudge against the Inferno Tower — not rage exactly, but the kind of patient resentment that accumulates over years of being melted. He does not discuss it. He calls the Witch "the small one" without irony and considers her the most reliable person he knows.

P.E.K.K.A
Nobody in the arena knows what is inside the P.E.K.K.A suit. The leading theory among arena scholars is that the suit is empty and operates on some form of enchantment, possibly anchored to the arena itself. A secondary theory holds that it contains a very small creature of enormous magical ability. A third theory, proposed once by Aldric the Ice Wizard and never repeated, is that the suit contains exactly what it always has and that the question is the wrong one to be asking. The suit's rivets are hand-forged in a style that metallurgists date to several centuries before the current arena administration. The suit itself shows no signs of wear. The P.E.K.K.A has a strange and intense fascination with mirrors and other reflective surfaces. She will pause in front of them and remain motionless for extended periods, regardless of context. Three opponents have attempted to use this against her in matches by placing polished shields in her path. Two of them deeply regretted it. She communicates exclusively through the mechanical sounds the suit produces: a sustained low grinding indicates displeasure, a short rhythmic clicking indicates acknowledgement, and a high intermittent tone that arena staff have begun calling "the hum" appears only after victories and has no agreed-upon interpretation. The Mini P.E.K.K.A idolises her completely and follows her when permitted, which she finds irritating in a way that has never caused her to actually stop it.

Hog Rider
The Hog Rider was born in Kragmoor, a highland region known for its steep terrain, its independent population, and its unusual relationship with domesticated hogs, which the Kragmoor people breed larger and more aggressively than anywhere else. He left the region at fifteen following a formal dispute with the village elders over what he described as "the criminal underuse of hogs as military assets," a position he has not moderated since. Thrak, his hog, was three weeks old when he found him abandoned at the edge of a field during a rainstorm. Thrak is now the largest hog in the arena by a margin that arena staff occasionally measure and record for reasons that are unclear. The Hog Rider considers Thrak his closest companion, his partner, and the better half of their tactical unit. He becomes visibly and genuinely upset when anyone refers to Thrak as "the hog," "the pig," "the boar," or "his mount." Thrak's name is Thrak. His battle cry translates from the Kragmoor dialect as "Thrak, go" and he has used no other words in a match in eleven years. He is one of the fastest ground troops in the arena and targets only buildings. He has a long and statistically lopsided rivalry with the Valkyrie, Sigrid, who has stopped him more times than any other card. He keeps a running count and is aware the number is not in his favour.

Valkyrie
The Valkyrie's name is Sigrid. She is the last surviving member of the Greyspine clan, a warrior tradition from the northern uplands that specialised in defensive formation fighting — heavy shields, tight lines, opponents who broke themselves against the wall. The Greyspine were not large in number. They were effective because they never broke formation. The clan does not exist anymore. Sigrid does not discuss what happened to them. The spinning technique that defines her fighting style was developed following a training accident at seventeen that shattered her left collarbone and rendered her left arm unreliable for generating power. She spent four months relearning how to fight. The spin generates rotational momentum that amplifies each strike more efficiently than a conventional swing, which she discovered by accident and refined methodically over the following years. She has never told anyone the origin of the technique and allows all assumptions to stand uncorrected. She keeps a small leather journal in her left boot, water-damaged at the edges, in which she records every Hog Rider push she has successfully stopped. The current count is forty-three, though the Hog Rider disputes two of them. She thinks he would be genuinely unstoppable if he ever changed his approach. She has not told him this. She trained alongside Edric the Knight in their early arena careers when both were considered unremarkable mid-tier cards unlikely to persist. She is one of two people who know his real name.

Witch
The Witch's name is Morwenna, and she was not always what she is now. Records that predate her arena career, sourced from the coastal settlement of Dunmore, describe a well-regarded village healer known for her calm under pressure, her knowledge of medicinal plants, and her patience with difficult patients. Dunmore was destroyed in a territorial dispute between two powers whose names no longer appear in current records. Morwenna was the only healer in the settlement. She arrived at the arena approximately eighteen months after Dunmore's destruction, speaking little, carrying nothing, and demonstrating skills she had not possessed before — specifically, the ability to summon and maintain a small army of skeletons and to emit a damaging pulse of dark energy in a ring around herself. She has not explained where these came from. She does not discuss Dunmore. In the arena she is formal, precise, and slightly cold to those she does not know well. She leaves small bundles of dried herbs near the Giant before significant matches, which is her private form of well-wishing that she would be embarrassed to have named as such. She considers the Night Witch a sister in the loose sense that two people who have both lost everything sometimes recognise something in each other without naming it. She finds the Night Witch's aggression stressful in the way that you find recklessness stressful when you care about the outcome.

Prince
The Prince's name is, according to him, simply "the Prince." He becomes visibly irate when asked for a surname, a family name, a region of origin, or documentation of any kind. Arena records contain no information about a kingdom, duchy, principality, or territory that claims him as royalty or former royalty. He owns seventeen capes. He has names for all of them. He travels with a separate trunk for cape storage, which is fitted with cedar lining to prevent moths, and he inspects each cape after every match for damage. He has a deep, consuming rivalry with his brother, the Dark Prince, which originated with a dispute over a cape collection left by their father and has since expanded to encompass their entire relationship. He practices his charging lance technique for exactly two hours every morning. He has done this for eleven years without a single skipped session. He is genuinely one of the best charging fighters in the arena by any measurable metric, which he considers proof that his worldview is correct. He is arrogant in a way that is exhausting to be around and difficult to argue with because, in narrow terms, he is usually right. He looks down on the Knight despite their roles being largely similar, because he cannot accept that someone who grew up on a farm could be in the same category as him.

Dark Prince
The Dark Prince's name has not been confirmed. He goes by "the Dark Prince" without complaint, which some arena observers interpret as acceptance and others interpret as quiet contempt for the whole naming exercise. He is the Prince's younger brother and has spent most of his adult life being compared to him unfavourably by people who do not know either of them well, which he handles with more grace than the Prince would manage in the same position. He fights with a short lance and a heavy shield, charges at enemies like his brother but also deals area damage in a radius on the charge hit. He is arguably more versatile. He would not say this unprompted. The dispute with his brother over the cape collection — seventeen capes that were left behind by their father — is technically about capes but is actually about everything else. He owns two capes of his own, both dark, both functional. He does not name them. He has a quiet, dry sense of humour that most people miss on first meeting and catch about three conversations later.

Mega Knight
The Mega Knight suit has been worn by at least four different individuals in its documented history, none of whom have ever been publicly identified before or after their tenure. The suit changes hands in circumstances that arena administration describes as "contractual transitions" and has declined to elaborate on. The current occupant has held the suit for approximately four years. Unlike the P.E.K.K.A, the Mega Knight communicates verbally, though rarely and in very short sentences. He has been observed saying "move," "enough," and once, memorably, "I was here first," the context for which was never established. He dislikes loud noises. This is the one personal detail that has been confirmed from multiple independent sources. He finds the noise of his own landing deeply unpleasant, which he has no way to address given that the landing is his primary ability. He considers the P.E.K.K.A an inferior warrior and refers to her suit as "the old suit," which she has not responded to. He is a loner by disposition and does not maintain alliances.

Electro Wizard
The Electro Wizard has never provided a name. Arena administration staff have taken to calling him "the Spark" in internal paperwork, a name he has neither accepted nor rejected. He arrived at the arena approximately two years ago with a story that arena staff have been unable to verify: that he spent three years living inside a lightning-struck communications tower on the Calven Plateau, surviving on rainwater collected in the bell housing and whatever birds were unlucky enough to land on the antenna. He told this story once, in full, to Aldric the Ice Wizard. He has not told it to anyone else and deflects when it is brought up. Whether it is true is unknown. What is confirmed: he cannot keep still. He taps surfaces constantly, shifts his weight from foot to foot during conversations, touches the wall when standing near one, and generates small unintentional static discharges when startled that have twice set minor fires in the preparation area. He is extraordinarily effective at his work — hitting two targets simultaneously, resetting charging abilities, arriving with a stunning entrance zap that disrupts entire pushes on deployment. He finds resetting the Sparky's charge deeply satisfying in a way he has tried to describe to Aldric and given up on. Aldric is the only person he sits still around.

Ice Wizard
The Ice Wizard's name is Aldric. He is the oldest person in the arena and will not say by how much. Arena records from three administrative eras ago reference an "ice mage" matching his description operating in an earlier version of the arena, which would make him considerably older than he appears. He deflects every question about his age with a short, pleasant laugh that suggests the question is the problem, not the answer. He speaks slowly. He gives advice to younger cards without being asked for it, which most find irritating and a handful have quietly admitted was useful in retrospect. He dresses in a light robe that is visibly inadequate for cold weather, which he has never explained given that he generates cold weather. He has been called back from retirement so many times that the word "retirement" no longer appears in his contracts — administration replaced it with "extended leave pending recall." He plays a strategy board game with the Electro Wizard between matches. The game has been running for what Aldric describes as "a considerable time." He wins more often than he loses. He does not say this to the Electro Wizard. He considers the Electro Wizard excellent company, which remains the most surprising thing most people learn about Aldric.

Night Witch
The Night Witch goes by no other name in arena records, which is either because she has not given one or because whoever received it decided not to record it. Her origins are vague in ways that suggest they were deliberately obscured rather than simply undocumented. She fights with a bat-topped staff, summons bats continuously, and is notably more aggressive than Morwenna in almost every respect — faster deployment, more forward positioning, shorter patience for defensive play. She and Morwenna, the Witch, share something that neither has put into words: a particular kind of loss that makes you either very careful or very reckless, and they went different directions. The Night Witch chose reckless. She considers Morwenna overcautious and occasionally says so. She means it as an observation rather than a criticism, though the distinction is sometimes lost. She has a dark, uneven sense of humour that surfaces at unpredictable moments and a habit of arriving slightly before she is deployed, which arena timing officials have flagged and never resolved.

Mini P.E.K.K.A
The Mini P.E.K.K.A is a smaller version of the P.E.K.K.A suit, origin unknown, and whether the two suits are related or merely similar is a question that nobody has been able to answer, including Aldric, who admits he does not know. The Mini P.E.K.K.A idolises the P.E.K.K.A completely. She follows her when permitted, mimics the sounds the larger suit makes, and has on at least three occasions attempted to stand in front of the same mirrors the P.E.K.K.A favours, which the P.E.K.K.A has never directly acknowledged. The Mini P.E.K.K.A communicates through similar mechanical sounds to the full suit but at a higher pitch, which the P.E.K.K.A finds irritating in a way that has not caused her to actually remove the Mini P.E.K.K.A from her vicinity. Arena staff interpret this as a form of tolerance. Whether it is affection is debated. The Mini P.E.K.K.A is a fast, high-damage melee card whose pancake-related battle cry has been discussed extensively and never satisfactorily explained.

Sparky
The Sparky is an electrical unit in a metal cage on wheels, built by an engineer whose name has been lost to arena record-keeping, who apparently left immediately after completing her. She charges electricity over several seconds before releasing a devastating blast that can eliminate most troops in a single hit, and she has been trying to successfully release that blast in the presence of the Electro Wizard for approximately two years without success. He resets her charge every time. He does not appear to register this as anything other than routine maintenance. She registers it as a personal injustice. Arena psychologists — a role that was created partially because of Sparky — have noted that she shows clear signs of goal-frustration and have suggested giving her matches where the Electro Wizard is not present. This has not happened. She is formidable in contexts where no reset ability is available, and devastating if she reaches a tower unimpeded. She has done this twice. She remembers both times.
