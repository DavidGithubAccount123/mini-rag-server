Knight — Strengths and Weaknesses
Edric's greatest strength is cost efficiency. At 3 elixir he provides more health and damage than almost any card at the same price, and he brings no expectations, no special requirements, and no conditions attached. Arena analysts have noted that his performance is statistically better in close matches than comfortable ones, which they attribute without much evidence to his background — he is accustomed to working hardest when the situation is worst. He is reliable on both offence and defence, capable of killing building-targeting troops, tanking damage for a push, and cleaning up individual threats. His weakness is single-target damage only — swarms of small troops overwhelm him without splash support. He is also outclassed in direct combat by higher-cost melee troops, which he is aware of and does not particularly mind.

Giant — Strengths and Weaknesses
The Giant's primary strength is his health pool, which forces opponents to spend significant elixir stopping him and frequently creates an elixir advantage for his team. He marches toward towers regardless of what is in front of him, which makes him consistent in a way that more reactive troops are not. His habit of pausing to look at wildflowers costs approximately half a second per instance and has not yet affected a match outcome, though arena analysts have flagged it in three separate reports that administration has not acted on. His weaknesses are his slow speed, his complete inability to target troops — anything placed in his path distracts him indefinitely — and his particular vulnerability to the Inferno Tower, whose ramping damage is the source of his longest-running grievance. He cannot target air troops.

P.E.K.K.A — Strengths and Weaknesses
The P.E.K.K.A's strength is her damage output and health pool combined — she eliminates tanks and high-value single targets better than any other card and can absorb enormous punishment in return. The mirror fascination has been tested as an exploitable weakness; results are mixed and the two opponents who have tried it most aggressively are no longer willing to discuss it. Her real weaknesses are her elixir cost of 7, her slow movement, and her complete helplessness against swarm troops. A Skeleton Army deployed at the right moment neutralises her entirely, which generates the low grinding tone that those familiar with her understand to indicate maximum displeasure. She is also slow to respond to rapidly shifting situations, which faster, cheaper decks exploit.

Hog Rider — Strengths and Weaknesses
The Hog Rider's strength is speed. Thrak is the fastest mount in the arena and has never stumbled in a match. The Hog Rider reaches the tower before most opponents have finished deciding how to respond. At 4 elixir he provides exceptional value. His weaknesses are his absolute fixation on buildings — he will divert to a defensive building every time — and his relatively low health for a win condition. Sigrid exploits the building fixation better than anyone. Arena analysts have quietly noted in internal documents that he would be significantly harder to stop if he varied his deployment timing or location, which he has not done in eleven years of recorded matches. He also has no splash damage, meaning troops placed in groups in his path absorb his attacks without difficulty.

Valkyrie — Strengths and Weaknesses
Sigrid's strength is her spinning area damage, which clears swarms more efficiently than almost any ground troop. The spin generates rotational momentum that amplifies each strike — it is biomechanically more effective than it appears and more effective than a conventional swing would be. Her journal of Hog Rider stops is secondary evidence of her consistency across different match contexts. Her weaknesses are her slow attack animation startup and her inability to target air troops under any circumstances. Bats, Minions, and the Baby Dragon fly safely over her head regardless of how often this costs her. She is also distracted by buildings in her path, which slows her forward progress in ways opponents learn to use.

Witch — Strengths and Weaknesses
Morwenna's strength is continuous output — the skeleton summons keep arriving at no additional elixir cost, providing persistent pressure and distraction that forces opponents to keep responding. Her area damage attack clears small swarms efficiently. The dried herb offerings have no documented combat effect. Her weaknesses are her fragility — she dies quickly to any splash damage that reaches her — and her near-total dependence on having a tank in front of her. Without the Giant or a similar troop absorbing tower fire, she is eliminated before the skeletons generate meaningful value. Sigrid's spin destroys her entire skeleton army in one rotation, which removes most of what makes her dangerous. She is expensive at 5 elixir for a card that cannot operate independently.

Prince — Strengths and Weaknesses
The Prince's strength is the charge damage multiplier, which produces one of the highest single-hit values in the arena. His morning practice has made the charge consistent to an unusual degree — he rarely mistimes it, rarely angles it wrong, and rarely charges into terrain he cannot clear. His cape collection has no effect on his combat effectiveness, though he inspects it after every match. His weaknesses are the charge reset mechanic — a single cheap troop placed in his path absorbs the hit and forces him to build the charge again — and his single-target damage, which makes him ineffective against groups. He has no defensive value. He does not acknowledge this as a limitation.

Dark Prince — Strengths and Weaknesses
The Dark Prince's strength is versatility. He charges like his brother but deals area damage in a radius on the charge hit, which means swarms do not stop him the way they stop the Prince. His shield also absorbs a hit before he takes damage, giving him effective health above what his base stat suggests. He is quieter and more adaptable than the Prince and generally draws less attention, which he treats as an advantage. His weaknesses are lower raw damage than the Prince's charge hit, and a higher elixir cost than his role sometimes justifies in a fast deck. He is also underestimated, which cuts both ways — opponents do not prepare for him and sometimes he goes further than expected, but he is also overlooked when credit is distributed after a match, which is a different kind of cost.

Mega Knight — Strengths and Weaknesses
The Mega Knight's strength is his landing. The deployment jump eliminates most troops in the landing zone instantly, which makes him one of the best reactive defensive plays in the arena — dropping him on top of a push can end it before it develops. His health pool ensures he survives what follows. He dislikes the sound his landing makes and has never found a way to address this. His weaknesses are his elixir cost of 7, his vulnerability to swarms that drain his health without giving him jump targets, and his slow movement once landed. The P.E.K.K.A wins a direct one-on-one by the numbers, which he disputes. He provides little value if deployed without high-value targets to land on.

Electro Wizard — Strengths and Weaknesses
The Electro Wizard's strength is his reset utility — hitting two targets per attack, resetting charging abilities, and arriving with a zap that stuns everything near the landing point. In decks built around protecting him, he provides continuous value against almost any push composition. The unintentional static discharges have twice provided marginal accidental combat value, which arena analysts have noted as interesting and have not been able to quantify. His weaknesses are his low health and low raw damage — he is purely utility and cannot carry anything on his own. He requires careful placement and dies immediately to splash damage that reaches him. Without synergy, he does not justify his elixir cost.

Ice Wizard — Strengths and Weaknesses
Aldric's strength is his slow effect applied to every attack, which makes all enemy troops in his range slower and less effective without requiring any additional investment. In a defensive context he converts dangerous pushes into manageable ones. He has likely encountered every push composition in three administrative eras of the arena and responds to each with the same unhurried attention. His advice to younger cards, while unsolicited, has been privately credited with improving performance in at least four documented cases. His weaknesses are his very low damage — he cannot kill anything unassisted and functions entirely as a multiplier for other troops — and his inability to target air, which leaves him exposed to air pushes without support. He is aware of both limitations and does not consider them worth dwelling on.

Night Witch — Strengths and Weaknesses
The Night Witch's strength is aggressive bat summoning combined with her forward positioning. The bats arrive continuously and threaten air and ground targets, forcing opponents to commit to an answer rather than waiting. She is faster to deploy value than Morwenna and more comfortable committing to a lane without guaranteed return. Her recklessness, as Morwenna frames it, is in some contexts her most effective quality — opponents who expect careful play from a summoner card are sometimes underprepared for how far forward she goes. Her weaknesses are her fragility and her dependence on the bats not being eliminated before they generate value. Area damage cards — Wizards, Witch, Executioner — clear her bat summons immediately and leave her exposed. She also provides less defensive value than Morwenna in a reactive context because she is not positioned for it.

Mini P.E.K.K.A — Strengths and Weaknesses
The Mini P.E.K.K.A's strength is damage output relative to cost. She hits harder per strike than her size suggests and moves faster than the full P.E.K.K.A suit. She is effective against single targets, particularly tanks that her damage can work through quickly. Her preference for standing in front of mirrors the P.E.K.K.A is using has not been recorded as a strength or weakness in official documentation. Her weaknesses are her vulnerability to swarms — like the larger suit, she deals single-target damage and is overwhelmed by groups of small troops — and her relatively low health compared to the full P.E.K.K.A. She is a less stable investment than the larger suit and is eliminated more easily by cards that can kite or surround her.

Sparky — Strengths and Weaknesses
The Sparky's strength is devastating — when her electrical charge releases into a group of troops or a tower, the damage is among the highest single-blast values in the arena. In matches without any card capable of resetting her charge, she is extremely difficult to answer. She has successfully released her full charge into an opponent's tower twice. She remembers both occasions clearly. Her weaknesses are her charge-up time, which leaves her vulnerable to attack while building, and her near-total shutdown by any card with a reset ability. The Electro Wizard in particular is her specific counter and has not allowed her to fire in his presence in two years of matches. She also moves slowly and cannot respond to threats on her flanks during the charge phase, which opponents have learned to use.
